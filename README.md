SugarStellar is a short game with gameplay and visuals inspired by the [bygone era of vector arcade games](http://www.museumofplay.org/blog/chegheads/2011/08/gone-but-not-forgotten-vector-games/), especially Asteroids.<img width="503" alt="Screen Shot 2024-10-25 at 5 59 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70bad1e2-1500-4fc2-a684-6369c78410dd">

You can  watch gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYz5-mXopbM&feature=youtu.be&t=840 

If you want to play, you can play in your browser on Itch.io.  I'm not going to link that directly here because one of our projects has a somewhat spicy name.

Game by by Deanna (code, original script, bad art), Oth (good art), Anna (adding puns), Scott Smigiel (music).
