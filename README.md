Let's pretend there was a game called SugarStellar, "a forgotten arcade romance from 1981" about delivering sweets in space. This short game has gameplay and visuals inspired by the [bygone era of vector arcade games](http://www.museumofplay.org/blog/chegheads/2011/08/gone-but-not-forgotten-vector-games/), especially Asteroids.

This repo contains the Unity project for the game:
- C# source code is in Assets/Scripts 
- Art is in Assets/Art
- Music is in Assets/Audio

Ready-to-play builds of the game can be found at https://sugarstellar.itch.io/sugarstellar
