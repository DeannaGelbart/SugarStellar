Let's pretend there was a game called SugarStellar, "a forgotten arcade romcom from 1981" about delivering sweets in space. This short game has gameplay and visuals inspired by the bygone era of vector arcade games.

This repo contains the Unity project for the game:
- C# source code is in the Assets/Scripts folder
- Art is in the Assets/Art and Materials folder
- Music is in the Assets/Audio folder.

Ready-to-play builds of the game can be found at https://sugarstellar.itch.io/sugarstellar

#Licensing

All the original C# code, art & music in the above-mentioned folders

You can attribute code and art to SugarStellar, and music to Scott Smigiel.

A small amount of the C# source code was taken from the
Unity online forum, and is labeled as such in the code comments.
So the above license does not apply to it as we are not the authors
-- it's just 2 pieces of code.  i can put in a library file of its
own, that would be nice, and put this comment there
