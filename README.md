Presenting the first ever emulator for SugarStellar, an action / romance arcade game from 1981!

OK, I'll level with you: it's not an emulator and the game did not actually exist in 1981.

This short game has gameplay and visuals inspired by the [bygone era of vector arcade games](http://www.museumofplay.org/blog/chegheads/2011/08/gone-but-not-forgotten-vector-games/), especially Asteroids.

You can play it in your browser at https://sugarstellar.itch.io/sugarstellar

You can also watch some gameplay at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYz5-mXopbM&feature=youtu.be&t=840
