OK, I'll level with you: it's not an emulator and the game did not actually exist in 1981.

This short game has gameplay and visuals inspired by the [bygone era of vector arcade games](http://www.museumofplay.org/blog/chegheads/2011/08/gone-but-not-forgotten-vector-games/), especially Asteroids.<img width="503" alt="Screen Shot 2024-10-25 at 5 59 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70bad1e2-1500-4fc2-a684-6369c78410dd">
